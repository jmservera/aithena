### Architecture Plan — aithena Solr Migration (2026-03-13)

**Author:** Ripley (Lead)  
**Status:** PROPOSED — awaiting team review  
**Branch:** `jmservera/solrstreamlitui`

#### Executive Summary

Solid SolrCloud infrastructure exists, but the indexing pipeline is Qdrant-bound. Plan: 4-phase migration to Solr-native search with semantic layer (Phase 3).

**Phases:**
1. **Core Solr Indexing:** Fix volume mounting, add schema fields, rewrite indexer for Tika extraction, metadata extraction module
2. **Search API & UI:** FastAPI search service, React search interface with faceting, PDF viewer
3. **Embeddings Enhancement:** Vector field in Solr, embedding indexing pipeline, hybrid search mode, similar books feature
4. **Polish:** File watcher (60s polling), PDF upload endpoint, admin dashboard, production hardening

#### Key Architectural Decisions (ADRs)

| ADR | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| ADR-001 | Hybrid indexing: Solr Tika (full-text) + app-side chunking (embeddings, Ph.3) | Fast Phase 1 execution, better control for Phase 3 |
| ADR-002 | Build metadata extraction module for filesystem path parsing | Explicit book fields (title, author, year, category) in Solr |
| ADR-003 | FastAPI for search API | Consistent with Python backend stack, thin Solr wrapper |
| ADR-004 | Standardize on `distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v2` (Phase 3) | Lightweight, good multilingual support; resolve Dockerfile/main.py mismatch |
| ADR-005 | React UI rewrite (chat → search), keep Vite/TS scaffolding | Paradigm shift requires component rewrite, not refactor |

#### Team Assignments

| Member | Ph.1 | Ph.2 | Ph.3 | Ph.4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Parker** (backend) | Indexer rewrite, metadata extraction, volume fix | Search API (FastAPI) | Embedding pipeline, hybrid search | Upload endpoint, file watcher |
| **Dallas** (frontend) | — | Search UI, PDF viewer | Similar books feature | Upload UI |
| **Ash** (search) | Schema fields (title, author, year, category, etc.) | Search API tuning | Vector field config, kNN setup | — |
| **Lambert** (tester) | Integration tests (PDF → Solr) | API + UI tests | Embedding quality tests | E2E tests, production hardening |
| **Ripley** (lead) | Architecture review, decision approval | API contract review | Model selection review | Production readiness review |

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Ash: Add book-specific fields to Solr schema (title_s, author_s, year_i, category_s, etc.)
2. Parker: Fix `docker-compose.yml` volume mapping (`/home/jmservera/booklibrary` → `/data/documents`)
3. Parker: Rewrite `document-indexer` for Solr Tika extraction (drop Qdrant dependency)
4. Parker: Build metadata extraction module with path parsing (support `Author/Title.pdf`, `Category/Author - Title (Year).pdf` patterns)
5. Lambert: Write tests for metadata extraction using actual library paths
6. Ripley: Review & approve schema changes before cluster deployment

#### Critical Gaps (to fix in Ph.1)

1. Book library (`/home/jmservera/booklibrary`) not mounted in docker-compose
2. Indexer fully Qdrant-dependent (imports `qdrant_client`, uses `pdfplumber` not Solr Tika)
3. No search API (qdrant-search commented out)
4. Schema lacks explicit book domain fields
5. Embeddings model mismatch (Dockerfile vs main.py)
6. React UI designed for chat, not search

#### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Large PDF library overwhelms Solr Tika | HIGH | Batch with backpressure (RabbitMQ prefetch=1), retry + DLQ |
| Old books have OCR-quality text | MEDIUM | Accept lower quality; embeddings may handle noisy text better |
| Solr kNN search performance at scale | MEDIUM | Benchmark with real data in Phase 3 (Solr 9.x HNSW suitable for <1M vectors) |
| Docker bind-mount perf on macOS | LOW | Dev only; production on Linux is fine |
| Metadata heuristics fail on irregular paths | MEDIUM | Build with fallback defaults (title=filename, author="Unknown"), improve iteratively |

## Phase 1 Implementation Decisions

### Ash — Schema Field Design

**Author:** Ash (Search Engineer)  
**Date:** 2026-03-13  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

**Decision:**
- Add explicit single-value fields for title, author, year, page count, file path, folder path, category, file size, and detected language.
- Copy `title_t` and `author_t` into `_text_` so the catch-all default query field includes book metadata.
- Keep `_text_` unstored in Phase 1 to avoid duplicating the full extracted body; use `content` as the stored highlight source and configure `_text_` highlighting with `f._text_.hl.alternateField=content`.

**Impact:**
- Parker can populate stable Solr field names directly from filesystem metadata extraction.
- Search clients can use `/select` or `/query` with default highlighting and receive snippets from `content` while still querying against `_text_`.
- Existing Tika/PDF metadata remains available for later tuning and faceting work.

### Parker — Solr Indexer Rewrite

**Author:** Parker (Backend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-03-13  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

**Context:**
Phase 1 required the indexer to stop treating the library as Azure/Qdrant-backed storage and instead process local PDFs mounted into the containers.

**Decision:**
The rewritten `document-indexer` now treats RabbitMQ messages as local filesystem paths under `/data/documents` and sends the raw PDF to Solr's `/update/extract` handler with `literal.*` metadata fields.

**Metadata Heuristic:**
For single-folder paths, infer the parent folder as the author only when the filename does not look like a journal/category pattern. Journal/category signals currently include:
- Uppercase underscore series names
- Explicit year ranges like `1885 - 1886`
- Category-like folder names echoed in the filename (e.g., `balearics/ESTUDIS_BALEARICS_01.pdf`)

Otherwise, use the parent folder as author and strip repeated author tokens from the title (e.g., `amades/... amades.pdf`).

**Impact:**
- Keeps Phase 1 indexing working with the real mounted library while preserving support for requested `Author/Title.pdf` and `Category/Author - Title (Year).pdf` conventions.
- Avoids coupling indexing to Azure Blob Storage or Qdrant, which are no longer part of the Solr-first pipeline.

### Lambert — Metadata Extraction Test Contract

**Author:** Lambert (Tester)  
**Date:** 2026-03-13  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

**Test-Facing Decisions:**

1. `extract_metadata()` should return `file_path` and `folder_path` relative to `base_path`.
2. Real library conventions are mixed:
   - `amades/` should be treated as an author folder.
   - `balearics/` should be treated as a category/series folder.
   - `bsal/` is a category-like folder, but filenames containing year ranges such as `1885 - 1886` must not trigger `author - title` parsing or set `year`.
3. Unknown or unsupported shapes should stay conservative:
   - title = raw filename stem
   - author = `Unknown`
   - extra nesting must not invent an author from intermediate folders
4. Fallback title handling should preserve the original stem for unknown patterns (including underscores), because the spec explicitly says `title=filename`.

**Impact:**
These expectations are now encoded in `document-indexer/tests/test_metadata.py`. Parker and Ash should align implementation + Solr field usage to this contract so metadata is stable for indexing, faceting, and UI display.

## Phase 1 Polish & Metadata Decisions

### Parker — Metadata Extraction Heuristic Refinements

**Author:** Parker (Backend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-03-13  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

**Decision:**
Refined metadata extraction to handle real library conventions more robustly:

1. **Preserve raw filename stem** as the fallback title for unknown patterns so special characters like underscores are not normalized away.
2. **Only infer `category/author`** from directory structure when the relative path is exactly two levels deep; deeper archive paths should keep the top-level category and leave author unknown unless the filename supplies one.
3. **Treat year ranges** such as `1885 - 1886` as series metadata rather than a single publication year.
4. **Normalize category acronyms** like `bsal` to uppercase when used as categories.

**Impact:**
- Metadata extraction now handles edge cases in the real library structure (`amades/`, `balearics/`, `bsal/`) consistently.
- Fallback title behavior is explicit and preserved; title=filename for unknown patterns.
- Indexing pipeline produces stable, predictable field values for Solr schema and UI display.

## Ripley — Phase 2–4 Issue Decomposition

**Author:** Ripley (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-03-13  
**Status:** ACTIVE

**Decision:**
Track the remaining Solr migration work as 18 single-owner GitHub issues assigned to `@copilot`, ordered by dependency and release:

- **v0.4.0 / Phase 2:** Issues #36–#41 (Solr FastAPI search service)
- **v0.5.0 / Phase 3:** Issues #42–#47 (React search, embeddings, hybrid search)
- **v0.6.0 / Phase 4:** Issues #48–#53 (File watcher, upload endpoint, admin, E2E)

**Dependency Backbone:**
1. Solr FastAPI search service first.
2. React search rewrite, faceting, PDF viewing, and frontend tests on that service.
3. Embeddings model alignment before Solr vector schema, before indexer chunk/vector indexing, before hybrid search and similar-books.
4. 60s polling in `document-lister` before upload/admin polish, with E2E tests last.

**Team-Level Scope Choice:**
The PDF upload endpoint lives in the FastAPI backend (not a new service) to reuse the existing Redis/RabbitMQ/Solr ingestion path and avoid unnecessary service sprawl.

**Impact:**
- Squad triage can route Phase 2 work immediately without reopening architecture questions.
- Later semantic and polish work references concrete dependencies instead of broad phase notes.
- Future PR reviewers can validate against the numbered dependency chain rather than the epic-style roadmap.

## User Directive — Local Testing Setup

**Captured:** 2026-03-13T19:47:58Z  
**Source:** jmservera (via Copilot)

**Directive:**
To test the current setup locally, spin up the Docker Compose containers and assign a volume to `/home/jmservera/booklibrary` so the team has access to the local books.

**Why:** Critical context for all testing and development work in Phases 1–4.
