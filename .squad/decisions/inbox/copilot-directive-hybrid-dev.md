### 2026-03-14T10:19: User directive — hybrid dev workflow
**By:** jmservera (via Copilot)
**What:** Run stable infrastructure (Solr, ZooKeeper, Redis, RabbitMQ) in Docker, but run the code being debugged (solr-search, document-indexer, aithena-ui, etc.) directly on the host. This makes debugging and fixing easier when the rest of the solution is already working correctly.
**Why:** User preference — faster dev loop, easier debugging, only containerize stable infra
