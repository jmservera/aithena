# Decision: Backlog Organization into GitHub Milestones

**Author:** Ripley (Lead)
**Date:** 2026-03-14
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The backlog had 49 open issues with no milestone structure. 13 issues were completed by merged PRs but never closed. Work needed grouping into release phases with clear completion criteria and a pause-reflect-reskill cadence.

## Actions Taken

- **Created 5 GitHub milestones** (v0.3.0 through v1.0.0)
- **Closed 13 issues** completed by merged PRs (#81–#84, #91, #110–#113, #124–#126, #133)
- **Assigned 36 remaining open issues** to milestones

## Milestone Structure

### v0.3.0 — Stabilize Core (5 issues)

Finish the UV/ruff migration cleanup and document the new dev setup.

| # | Title | Owner |
|---|-------|-------|
| 92 | UV-8: Update buildall.sh and CI for uv | Dallas |
| 95 | LINT-4: Replace pylint/black with ruff in document-lister | Ripley |
| 96 | DOC-1: Document uv migration and dev setup in README | Dallas |
| 99 | LINT-5: Run ruff auto-fix across all Python services | Lambert |
| 100 | LINT-6: Run eslint + prettier auto-fix on aithena-ui | Dallas |

**Done when:** `buildall.sh` works with uv, all Python services pass `ruff check`, README has current dev setup instructions, CI green.
**Effort:** ~2–3 sessions.

### v0.4.0 — Dashboard & Polish (7 issues)

Add dashboard endpoints + React tabs, establish frontend lint/test baseline.

| # | Title | Owner |
|---|-------|-------|
| 114 | P4: Add /v1/status/ endpoint to solr-search | Parker |
| 120 | P4: Add tab navigation to React UI | Dallas |
| 121 | P4: Build Stats tab in React UI | Dallas/Copilot |
| 122 | P4: Build Status tab in React UI | Dallas/Copilot |
| 41 | Phase 2: Add frontend test coverage | Parker |
| 93 | LINT-2: Add prettier config for aithena-ui | Dallas |
| 94 | LINT-3: Add eslint + prettier CI jobs for frontend | Dallas |

**Done when:** Status + Stats endpoints return real data, React UI has 4 tabs (Search/Library/Status/Stats), eslint+prettier CI green, frontend test coverage > 0%.
**Effort:** ~4–5 sessions.

### v0.5.0 — Advanced Search (3 issues)

Page-level search results and similar-books UI.

| # | Title | Owner |
|---|-------|-------|
| 134 | Return page numbers in search results from chunk-level hits | Ash/Parker |
| 135 | Open PDF viewer at specific page from search results | Dallas |
| 47 | Phase 3: Show similar books in React UI | Parker |

**Done when:** Search results show page numbers, clicking a result opens PDF at the correct page, similar-books panel renders for each book.
**Effort:** ~3–4 sessions.

### v0.6.0 — Security & Hardening (19 issues)

Security CI pipeline, vulnerability remediation, docker hardening.

| # | Title | Owner |
|---|-------|-------|
| 88 | SEC-1: Add bandit Python security scanning to CI | Kane/Ripley |
| 89 | SEC-2: Add checkov IaC scanning to CI | Kane/Ripley |
| 90 | SEC-3: Add zizmor GitHub Actions security scanning | Kane/Ripley |
| 97 | SEC-4: Create OWASP ZAP manual security audit guide | Kane |
| 98 | SEC-5: Security scanning validation and baseline tuning | Lambert |
| 52 | Phase 4: Harden docker-compose and service health checks | Brett |
| 5–7, 17–18, 20, 29–35 | Mend dependency vulnerability fixes (13 issues) | Kane/Copilot |

**Done when:** bandit+checkov+zizmor CI green, all HIGH+ Mend vulnerabilities resolved or suppressed with justification, docker-compose has health checks on all services.
**Note:** Many Mend issues may be auto-resolved — qdrant-clean/qdrant-search/llama-server were removed in PR #115. Triage each: close if the vulnerable package is gone, fix or suppress if still present.
**Effort:** ~5–6 sessions.

### v1.0.0 — Production Ready (2 issues + future work)

Upload flow, E2E coverage, production stability.

| # | Title | Owner |
|---|-------|-------|
| 49 | Phase 4: Add a PDF upload endpoint to the FastAPI backend | Parker |
| 50 | Phase 4: Build a PDF upload flow in the React UI | Dallas |

**Future work (no issues yet):**
- Vector/semantic search validation end-to-end
- Hybrid search mode toggle in UI
- Branch rename (dev → main)
- Full test coverage (backend + frontend)
- docker-compose.infra.yml for hybrid local dev

**Done when:** Full upload → index → search → view flow works E2E, branch renamed, CI green on default branch, all services have tests.
**Effort:** ~8–10 sessions.

## Cadence

After each milestone is complete:

1. **Pause** — Stop new feature work
2. **Scribe logs** — Scribe captures session learnings, updates decisions.md
3. **Reskill** — Team reviews what worked, what didn't, update charters if needed
4. **Tag release** — `git tag v{X.Y.0}` on dev
5. **Merge to default** — PR from dev to main (once branch rename happens, this simplifies)
