### Branching Strategy — Release Gating
**Date:** 2026-03-14
**Author:** Ripley (Lead)
**Approved by:** Juanma (Product Owner)

#### Branches
- `dev` — active development, all squad/copilot PRs target this
- `main` — production-ready, always has a working version
- Feature branches: `squad/{issue}-{slug}` or `copilot/{slug}` — short-lived, merge to `dev`

#### Release Flow
1. Work happens on `dev` (PRs from feature branches)
2. At phase end, Ripley or Juanma runs integration test on `dev`
3. If tests pass: merge `dev` → `main`
4. Create semver tag: `git tag -a v{X.Y.Z} -m "Release v{X.Y.Z}: {phase description}"`
5. Push tag: `git push origin v{X.Y.Z}`

#### Merge Authority
- `dev` ← feature branches: any squad member can merge (with Ripley review)
- `main` ← `dev`: ONLY Ripley or Juanma
- Tags: ONLY Ripley or Juanma

#### Current Version

- v0.1.0 — Phase 1 (Solr indexing) ✅
- v0.2.0 — Phase 2 (Search API + UI) ✅
