### 2026-03-14T09:45: User directive — remove Azure dependencies
**By:** jmservera (via Copilot)
**What:** This is a completely on-prem project that must run on docker compose without external dependencies. Remove any dependency on Azure (azure-identity, azure-storage-blob in document-lister). The Dependabot azure-identity alert will resolve itself once the dependency is removed.
**Why:** User request — on-prem only, no cloud provider dependencies
