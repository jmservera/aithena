## Consolidated Learnings

### Architecture Patterns (proven across v1.4.0–v1.10.0)

1. **Separation of concerns:** Pages compose components + hooks. Components are presentational only. Hooks own state + API calls. `api.ts` is the only module making HTTP calls.
2. **Hook cleanup:** Always use `cancelled` flag + `AbortController` in data-fetching hooks to prevent memory leaks and race conditions.
3. **Polling hooks:** Use `setTimeout` chaining (not `setInterval`) for status polling. Explicitly handle `AbortError` as non-error.
4. **Search state reset:** Always reset pagination to page 1 when query/filters change. Use immutable state updates.
5. **Error boundaries:** Must be route-aware — reset on navigation via `useLocation()`. Nest boundaries to isolate sections (search results, upload panel).
6. **CSS:** Global CSS + BEM naming. CSS Modules emerging for isolated components (Footer, LoadingSpinner). Dark theme with `#282c34` bg, `#7ec8e3` accent.
7. **Auth:** Cookie-based (`aithena_auth`, HttpOnly, SameSite=lax). AuthContext wraps app. ProtectedRoute/AdminRoute for gating. `credentials: 'include'` on all API calls.

### i18n Patterns (established v1.6.0–v1.7.0)

1. **Key naming:** `domain.featureKey` (lowerCamelCase, dot-separated). Domains: search, filter, books, error, language, admin, upload, navigation, status, stats, app.
2. **Module-level arrays:** Use `labelId` pattern (not `label`), resolve at render time via `useIntl()`.
3. **Helpers → Components:** Convert helper functions to React components when they need hooks (e.g., `renderLazyRoute` → `LazyRoute` component).
4. **localStorage:** `aithena.locale` (dot-notation). Auto-migration from old keys on first load.
5. **Translation verification:** Locale completeness tests check keys exist but NOT that values differ from English. Consider adding "untranslated value" detection.

### Toolchain & Build (proven across migrations)

1. **ESLint migrations (v8→v9→v10):** Low-risk if tests are comprehensive and linting is strict (`--max-warnings 0`).
2. **API URL resolution:** Centralized `buildApiUrl()` in `api.ts`. Supports `VITE_API_URL` as ".", unset, or full URL. Localhost fallback for dev.
3. **Document URL normalization:** `resolveDocumentUrl()` strips internal Docker hostnames from backend-generated absolute URLs, keeping only the `/documents/` path.
4. **Vite ESM:** `vite.config.ts` needs `dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))` — no `__dirname` in ESM.
5. **Vite proxy:** Dev proxy rules for `/v1` and `/documents` route to `http://localhost:8080`.

### Accessibility (established v1.8.0+)

1. **Skip-to-content link** with CSS show-on-focus + i18n labels.
2. **Focus management** on route changes via `useEffect` + `useLocation` + mainRef.
3. **Contrast:** Minimum rgba opacity 0.65 for WCAG AA 4.5:1 ratio.
4. **Media queries:** `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables animations. `prefers-contrast: more` enhances backgrounds.
5. **ARIA:** `aria-modal="true"` on dialogs, `role="img"` on health dots, `scope="col"` on table headers.
6. **Static analysis:** eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y catches redundant roles, missing keyboard handlers. Covers ~70% of WCAG; remaining 30% needs browser-based audit.

### E2E & Testing Patterns

1. **Emoji in headless Chromium:** Never use exact emoji matching. Use `toContainText` with text-only portion.
2. **React controlled checkboxes:** Playwright `.check()` may fail. Click the label element instead.
3. **File upload testing:** Manual `dispatchEvent` needed when testing accept-attribute filtering.
4. **IntlWrapper:** All component tests must wrap with `IntlWrapper` for react-intl compatibility.
5. **XSS sanitization:** `sanitizeHighlight()` strips all HTML except Solr's `<em>` tags. Always use for `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

### Responsive CSS (learned v1.10.0)

1. **Grid:** Use `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(280px, 1fr))` — never fixed column counts.
2. **Overflow prevention:** `min-width: 0` + `overflow: hidden` on grid items. `overflow-wrap: anywhere` on text.
3. **Mobile navigation:** Needs dedicated hamburger toggle + i18n labels.

## Reskill Notes (2026-03-20)

### Self-Assessment
- **Strongest areas:** i18n architecture, hook patterns, component separation, test coverage, API integration
- **Growing areas:** Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), responsive design, CSS Modules adoption, E2E Playwright
- **Knowledge gaps:** CSS Modules best practices (only 2 files use them), dark/light theme toggle, advanced Playwright patterns, Collections UI (backend API ready, no frontend yet)

### Stale Information Corrected
- React version: was listed as RC, now stable `^19.0.0`
- react-intl: was `6.8.1`, now `^10.0.0`
- Vitest: was `2.1.8`, now `^4.1.0`
- Vite: was `5.x`, now `^8.0.0`
- Prettier: was incorrectly listed as `10.1.8`, actually `^3.8.1`
- Component count: was ~20, now ~30 (added skeletons, auth, folder tree, error states)
- Page count: was 5, now 9 (added Login, Admin, Profile, UserManagement, ChangePassword)
- Hook count: was ~5, now 11 (added admin, library, users, useSearchState)
- CSS Modules emerging alongside global CSS (Footer, LoadingSpinner)
- Lucide React now in deps (replaced emoji icons)
- eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y added for a11y linting
- AuthContext + ProtectedRoute pattern established

### Patterns Extracted to Skills
- `vitest-testing-patterns` — Vitest + RTL testing patterns for aithena
- `accessibility-wcag-react` — WCAG 2.1 AA patterns for React apps
- Updated `react-frontend-patterns` — corrected versions, expanded component/hook inventory

### What Would Help Most
1. Collections UI skill (once frontend is built)
2. CSS Modules migration guide (transitioning from global CSS)
3. Dark/light theme implementation pattern
4. Advanced Playwright E2E patterns for React SPAs

### Folder Batch Integration (#656, 2026-03-21)

**Query-based batch editing:** Added `BatchQueryContext` type to `useBatchMetadataEdit` — when provided, the hook calls `/metadata-by-query` with query+filters instead of `/batch/metadata` with explicit IDs. The `save()` function branches based on `queryContext` presence, keeping backward compatibility.

**"Select all N matching" UX:** When total results exceed visible page size, a "Select all N matching results" button appears. This sets `allMatchingSelected` state, which passes `queryContext` (with current query + active filters including folder) to `BatchEditPanel`. Individual checkbox toggles reset `allMatchingSelected` to prevent mixed-mode confusion.

**i18n pattern:** Used `{count, plural, one {# matching result} other {# matching results}}` for the selectAllMatching key — follows established ICU MessageFormat pattern from existing batch keys.

### Version Display Fix (#810, 2026-07-17)

**Bug:** UI footer showed stale version (e.g. v1.0.0) instead of actual version from VERSION file.

**Root cause:** `getVersion()` in `vite.config.ts` checked `process.env.VERSION` before the VERSION file. A stale env var (from `.env`, Docker cache, or shell) would override the actual VERSION file.

**Fix:** Flipped resolution priority — VERSION file first, env var fallback. Also updated Dockerfile to write the VERSION build arg to a file so the file-based path works inside Docker builds.

**Learnings:**
- The VERSION file at repo root is the single source of truth; always prefer reading it over env vars.
- Docker build context for aithena-ui is `./src/aithena-ui/`, so the repo-root VERSION file is not in context. Must write it from the build arg in the Dockerfile.
- `.env.example` files contain stale VERSION values (0.8.0, 1.4.0) — operators copying these to `.env` get wrong versions. Flagged for infra team to fix.
### PDF Viewer Toolbar Redesign (#814, #815, #816 — PR #836)

**Toolbar pattern:** Replaced the old header/close-button layout with a horizontal toolbar: title on left (truncated), grouped action buttons on right. BEM naming: `.pdf-viewer-toolbar`, `.pdf-viewer-toolbar__title`, `.pdf-viewer-toolbar__actions`, `.pdf-viewer-toolbar__btn`. This pattern is reusable for future panel/modal headers.

**Fullscreen toggle:** Uses `useState(isFullscreen)` + `useCallback(toggleFullscreen)`. ESC key handler checks `isFullscreen` before calling `onClose` — exits fullscreen first, then closes on second ESC. The `isFullscreen` dependency was added to the keydown `useEffect` deps array.

**Toolbar buttons as links:** Download and external-link use `<a>` elements styled as toolbar buttons (`.pdf-viewer-toolbar__btn` class on both `<button>` and `<a>`). Download uses native `download` attribute. External link uses `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

**Conditional rendering:** Download and external-link buttons only render when `pdfUrl` is truthy — avoids broken links when no document URL exists. Fullscreen and close always render.

**CSS fullscreen mode:** Separate modifier classes (`--fullscreen`) on both overlay and panel. Panel goes `width: 100vw; height: 100vh`, overlay background becomes transparent. No JS DOM manipulation needed — pure CSS class toggling.

### Decouple SimilarBooks from PDF Viewer (#820 — PR #841)

**State separation pattern:** Introduced `focusedBookId` state alongside `selectedBook` in SearchPage and LibraryPage. `selectedBook` controls the PDF viewer; `focusedBookId` controls the SimilarBooks panel. This allows similar books to render independently of the PDF viewer state and persist after closing the viewer.

**BookCard onSelect prop:** Added `onSelect?: (book: BookResult) => void` to BookCard. When provided, the `<article>` element gets `role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`, keyboard handlers (Enter/Space), and a `.book-card--selectable` CSS class with cursor/hover states. Interactive children (checkbox, menu, Open PDF button) use `stopPropagation` to prevent double-triggering.

**z-index layering:** `.similar-books-panel` gets `position: relative; z-index: 1001` to sit above the PDF viewer overlay (`z-index: 1000`). This ensures the panel is never obscured by the dark overlay when both are visible.

**a11y lint with conditional roles:** ESLint's `jsx-a11y/no-noninteractive-element-interactions` fires on `<article>` with event handlers. Since we conditionally apply `role="button"`, an inline `eslint-disable` comment is appropriate. The `stopPropagation` wrapper divs need `role="presentation"` + `onKeyDown` handler to satisfy `jsx-a11y/click-events-have-key-events` and `jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions`.

**Testing decoupled components:** When a parent element has `role="button"` and contains child buttons, `getByRole('button', { name: ... })` may match multiple elements. Use `getByLabelText` for specific child buttons instead.

### Chunk Text Display (#809, 2026-07-17)

**Feature:** Display vector search chunk text snippets in BookCard.

**Implementation:** Added `is_chunk`, `chunk_text`, `page_start`, `page_end` to `BookResult` type. When `is_chunk=true` and `chunk_text` is present, a visually distinct panel renders above keyword highlights with a left accent border and subtle blue background (`.book-chunk-text` CSS class). Page range shown when available (singular/plural).

**Learnings:**
- Used `book.*` i18n key prefix to stay consistent with existing BookCard keys rather than introducing a new `bookCard.*` domain prefix.
- Chunk text is plain text (no HTML sanitization needed) — unlike keyword highlights which come with `<em>` tags from Solr.
- Added `book.chunkPage` (singular) and `book.chunkPages` (plural) for page display — follows existing `book.foundOnPage`/`book.foundOnPages` pattern.
- 8 tests cover all edge cases: presence/absence of chunk, single vs. multi page, empty string, missing page range, coexistence with keyword highlights.

### BookDetailView Modal (#819, PR #842)

**Feature:** Modal overlay component showing full book metadata, similar books, and action buttons.

**Architecture:** Followed the established PdfViewer modal pattern — focus trap, ESC dismiss, body scroll lock, `aria-modal` — but adapted for a centered overlay (vs PdfViewer's side panel). Created `useBookDetail` hook with `initialData` prop pattern: when the caller already has `BookResult` from search results, it skips the API fetch entirely, avoiding a redundant `GET /v1/books/{book_id}` call.

**Content sections:** Header (title/author/year), metadata grid (category, language, series, page count, file size, folder path), chunk text preview (reuses existing `book.matchingText`/`book.chunkPage`/`book.chunkPages` i18n keys), action buttons (Open PDF, Open external, Edit metadata for admins), and SimilarBooks component integration.

**Learnings:**
- Used `bookDetail.*` i18n key prefix for modal-specific labels (close, loading, error, fileSize, folderPath, openExternal, untitled) — keeps them distinct from `book.*` keys used by BookCard.
- Added `file_size`, `folder_path`, `score` to `BookResult` interface — these fields exist in the backend `normalize_book()` response but were missing from the frontend type.
- Admin gating uses `useAuth().user?.role === 'admin'` — straightforward role check via AuthContext.
- Title appears in both toolbar and body header — test queries must use `getAllByText` or role-based selectors to avoid ambiguity.
- `SimilarBooks` heading text ("Similar Books") overlaps with loading text ("Loading similar books…") for `/similar books/i` regex — use `getByRole('region', { name: /similar books/i })` for the section.
- Backdrop click handler on `role="dialog"` triggers `jsx-a11y/click-events-have-key-events` — suppressed with eslint-disable since ESC is the keyboard equivalent.
- CSS: centered modal with `max-width: 800px`, responsive at 600px breakpoint (full-width, stacked layout). BEM naming `.book-detail-*`.
