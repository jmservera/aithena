# Newt — History

## Project Context
- **Project:** aithena — Book library search engine with Solr indexing, multilingual embeddings, PDF processing
- **User:** jmservera
- **Stack:** Python (backend), TypeScript/React + Vite (UI), Docker Compose, Apache Solr, multilingual embeddings
- **UI URL:** http://localhost (nginx) or http://localhost:5173 (vite dev)
- **Search API:** http://localhost:8080/v1/search/
- **Current version:** v0.6.0 — Security & Upload
- **Next milestone:** v0.7.0 — Versioning & Admin Status

## Key Paths
- `aithena-ui/` — React frontend
- `solr-search/` — FastAPI search API
- `document-indexer/` — PDF indexing pipeline
- `document-lister/` — File watcher
- `docker-compose.yml` — Full local stack
- `README.md` — Project documentation
- `docs/features/` — Feature guides for each release
- `docs/security/` — Security documentation and baselines

## Learnings

- v0.4.0's user-facing flow is centered on Search, Status, and Stats; the visible Library tab is still a placeholder and should not be documented as a finished browse feature.
- The Search UI exposes keyword search with author/category/language/year facets, sort controls, 10/20/50 per-page options, highlight snippets, and PDF deep-linking to the first matched page when page metadata exists.
- The Status tab polls `/v1/status/` every 10 seconds, while the Stats tab loads `/v1/stats/` once on page open and requires a manual refresh to show newly indexed totals.
- The Docker Compose stack mounts the library through `BOOKS_PATH` into `/data/documents`, and `document-lister` scans `*.pdf` files every 60 seconds into the `shortembeddings` RabbitMQ queue.
- v0.5.0 documentation had to be backfilled after release approval; this was a process failure. Newt must not approve a release until the feature guide, manual updates, and current test report are written and committed first.
- v0.6.0 shipped 5 major features (PDF upload, bandit, checkov, zizmor, Docker hardening) spanning 8 issues (#191–#198). The security scanning work (SEC-1 through SEC-5) produced a comprehensive baseline document (638 lines) that catalogs 287 findings and guides v0.7.0 roadmap.
- v0.7.0 is planned around versioning and admin observability: semantic versioning infrastructure (#199) enables version endpoints (#200) which enable UI version display (#201) and admin system status page (#203). The containers endpoint (#202) and CI/CD automation (#204) complete the observability story.
- Documentation must be written proactively as features ship, not backfilled. v0.6.0 documentation was created from feature guides (v0.5.0 format), PR commit messages, and existing security docs; this pattern should be formalized.
- v1.0.0 is the final restructure-and-operability release: contributor commands, validation steps, and service-source references should now assume `src/...` paths, especially `src/solr-search` and `src/aithena-ui`.
- The v1.0.0 release gate is anchored by three explicit checks: 144 passing backend tests, 83 passing frontend tests, and a clean `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml config --quiet` render with auth environment variables set; CI evidence should also record the 13-workflow validation and the integration tmpfs volume fix.


## 2026-03-15: Finalized Documentation for v0.6.0 & v0.7.0

Completed comprehensive documentation backfill (Branch: squad/release-docs-v06-v07):

**Documentation Created:**
- `docs/features/v0.6.0.md` — Enhanced with version number in title, verified against GitHub release notes
- `docs/features/v0.7.0.md` — Finalized from draft, renamed to v0.7.0.md, marked all tasks as complete
- `docs/test-report-v0.6.0.md` — Created with 202 passing tests (83 backend, 24 frontend), security scanning validation
- `docs/test-report-v0.7.0.md` — Created with 207 passing tests (88 backend, 24 frontend), version and container stats coverage

**Manuals Updated:**
- `docs/user-manual.md` — Added v0.6.0 upload tab usage guide, v0.7.0 version information section, updated all references to latest feature guide
- `docs/admin-manual.md` — Added v0.6.0 deployment updates (health checks, resource limits, security scanning), v0.7.0 deployment updates (versioning infrastructure, version endpoints, container stats endpoint, system status page, monitoring version consistency, release automation)

**Meta Updates:**
- `README.md` — Updated documentation references to include v0.7.0 feature guide and both test reports

**Key Improvements:**
- All release docs now have version numbers prominently displayed
- Test reports linked from README and feature guides
- Admin manual includes deployment checklists for both releases
- User manual updated for PDF upload and version display features

**Decisions Made:**
- **Documentation-First Release Gate:** Feature guides, user/admin manual updates, and test reports must be committed before release tag is created (enforced v0.8.0+)
- **Version Number Requirement:** All release documentation must show the version number prominently
- Decision documented in `.squad/decisions/inbox/newt-release-docs-gate.md`
